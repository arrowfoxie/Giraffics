# Giraffics

## AJAX and the Giphy API

This is a project created by using AJAX along with the Giphy API. Users can enter a search term for something in the field and 
a new button is added that generates at least 10 GIFs featuring the term searched.

* Note
this project does not currently have my Giphy API key and thus will not work.
